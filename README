10/20/2010 Gathering Screenshots for project.
10/27/2010 Screenshots and text gathered.  Ready to begin coding.  I will do this project in HTML code; it will be designed for mobile devices.  The project is to write an app that explains 4 different functions/features/settings of the BlackBerry device and how to adjust them to enhance the user experience.
12/15/2010 The final project has been uploaded to git.  In the process of forcing the push, I lost all commits made to the project since 10/27/2010.
